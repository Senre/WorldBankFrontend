## Introduction

This project uses analytics from the World Bank to create an App that will display all the data for a given country (or two) for a huge array of indicators. It contains a login and register system too, which allows users to create accounts in order to track previous searches, which can then be accessesed from the Home page. Using administrator credentials on the login page will give access to the admin area, which displays all searches made to the site.
